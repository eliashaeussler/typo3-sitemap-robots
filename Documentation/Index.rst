An extension for TYPO3 CMS that enhances :file:`robots.txt` from site
configuration with located XML sitemaps. Injection of sitemap configuration
can be managed on a per-site basis and is done by an additional frontend
middleware. The extension supports static routes as well as injection into
local files.
